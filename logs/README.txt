Todo list:
-Simplify the movies page so that it makes a simple fetch request to return all of the newest movies in order of date added
-Simplify the infinite loader so that it doesn't need to fetch movies twice, once for the infinite loader and the other for the parent component
-Add a day and night switch
-Use Lazy loading for the movie images
-Make sure it works on mobile as well, so make it responsive 
-Display the categories for the movies as well
-Add date searching as some of the features 
-Add the day and night toggle switch
-Make it look better using animations
-Have the links go straight to the Imbd page for the movie instead, I can't be bothered to copy and paste all of the information,
besides this was just a test to make sure the infinite scroll and lazy loading worked properly before I implemented them into my blog,
not an actual movies app

Done:
-Add date created to the movies
-Add category search feature
