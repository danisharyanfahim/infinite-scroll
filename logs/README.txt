Todo list:
-Nothing


Done:
-Add date created to the movies
-Add category search feature (Type in '#(category)' into the search bar to get movies by category)
-Stylizing it for the most part
-Make it look better using animations
-Display the categories for the movies as well
-Have the links go straight to the Imbd page for the movie instead, I can't be bothered to copy and paste all of the information,
besides this was just a test to make sure the infinite scroll and lazy loading worked properly before I implemented them into my blog,
not an actual movies app
-Use Lazy loading for the movie images
-Make sure it works on mobile as well, so make it responsive 
-Show film length and format in hours and minutes
-Add year of release searching as some of the features (Type in 'from:(releaseYear)' into the search bar to get movies by year)
-No Results were found page if the number of movies is 0
